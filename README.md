To use, clone the repository and place the "commands" folder inside your ".minecraft/scripts" folder and edit the "ticmats" array to contain the ITICMaterials you want dumped. I could find no way of iterating over them all without a hard coded array unfortunately. The bracket handlers in the array should look something like this: <ticmat:material_name>. This script requires CraftTweaker and ModTweaker, nothing else I think.
